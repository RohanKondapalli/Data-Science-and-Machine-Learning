# Data-Science-and-Machine-Learning
Real World AI - Summer Course 2020 - 6 weeks

This is my repository for my work done throughout the six-week course including my capstone project. I used the programming language R, as this is what we learned in class and what I found most helpful for achieving my goals. I used data science and machine learning to ultimately build and train models for real-world applications.
